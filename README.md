Description :

• Developed a dynamic Rock Paper Scissors web game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, enabling real-time gameplay between the user and the computer.

• Implemented score tracking for both user and computer, persisting data in browser localStorage to maintain scores across page reloads.

• Designed interactive UI components, including animated choice buttons and a rules popup modal with close functionality for enhanced user experience.

• Created custom celebration animations to display a hurray screen when the player wins, improving engagement and visual feedback.

• Handled game logic to determine outcomes (win, lose, draw) and dynamically update DOM elements to reflect results and user interactions.
