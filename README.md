Description :

• Developed a dynamic Rock Paper Scissors web game using vanilla **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, enabling real-time gameplay between the user and the computer.

• Implemented **score tracking** for both user and computer, persisting data in browser **localStorage** to maintain scores across page reloads.

• Designed interactive **UI components**, including **animated choice buttons** and a **rules popup modal** with close functionality for enhanced user experience.

• Created custom celebration animations to display a hurray screen when the player wins, improving engagement and visual feedback.

• Handled **game logic** to determine outcomes (win, lose, draw) and dynamically update **DOM elements** to reflect results and user interactions.
